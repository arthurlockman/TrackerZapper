TrackerZapper is a Mac app that sits in your menubar and silently removes tracking parameters from any links you copy.

[Download from the releases page](https://github.com/rknightuk/TrackerZapper/releases/latest)

Requires MacOS Big Sur or later because I don't have anything else to test on. It might work, give it a go.
